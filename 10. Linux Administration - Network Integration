Hello, I was scheduled to begin work today but I seem to have no access to my workstation. 
The workstation at my desk does not really seem to be setup at all! Please help!

Richard LeGrand
I JUST GOT THIS EMAIL FROM THE NEW TEMPORARY SECURITY CONSULTANT. MS. RANDOLPH DOES NOT YET HAVE 
AN ACCOUNT OR CONNECTED SYSTEM THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO AND I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, FIX IT.

Gary Thatcher
Hello @playerone as you can see things are a bit stressful lately and I have not had time to 
work on some of these more trivial matters, many other things have taken my attention so I leave 
the task in your capable hands. @gbates will tell you more.

Gilly Bates
Hi @playerone, I have been assigned to help you along with adding Ms. Randolph, 
our new temporary security consultant, to our network. There are certain considerations
that must be taken into account. 

Her workstation should be assigned 172.16.30.6 for the IP address; 
make sure to set the right subnet mask as well. We are a /24 network if you didn't know. 
Based on the IP address that would mean her workstation is in the Internal subnet and the gateway you set should reflect as such.

The DNS server address also needs to be manually set on her workstation so it can resolve internal and external names. 
Since our DNS server also happens to be our Domain-Controller, you can find it's IP address on the network map.

Oh! Almost forgot, you will need to add a DNS entry for her workstation in the DNS server on the Domain-Controller. 
Her workstation FQDN should be SecConsultantKali.daswebs.com and to make it all match up the workstation hostname needs to be set to SecConsultantKali.

Gilly Bates
So.. that takes care of all the network stuff I think. Once you are done with that you need to 
make sure she has sufficient local machine access so she can get her sensitive work done. 
Our naming guidelines are always first initial plus last name (all lowercase) for usernames 
so we will just do that here for Ms. Randolph. Not sure how you usually create users but just 
make sure her user account also gets a home directory in the usual /home/herusername/ way. 

Also, since I'm not sure what she is doing, or if we should ask, just give her full sudo access on her workstation. Anything else @drandolph?

Dedeker Randolph
All that sounds fine to me. As one other thing I'd like @playerone, make sure my default shell is bash. Other than that we are good! Thanks!



The requirements are:

Set the workstation for D. Rudolph to SecConsultantKali, 172.16.30.6/24 with 172.16.5 as the gateway and the AD (Domain-Controller) 172.16.30.2 as the DNS server.

On the DNS server:
Control Panel > Administrative Tools > DNS Manager
AD > Forward Lookup Zones > daswebs.com
Right click on daswebs.com > New Host (A or AAAA)

Set the name to SecConsultantKali
Set the domain name to daswebs.com
Set the IP address to 172.16.30.6
Checked create associated pointer record

On the Security-Desk Workstation:

(I took the screenshots after I had completed the challenge so the hostname is already SecConsultantKali instead of Security-Desk)

Changed the hostname:
